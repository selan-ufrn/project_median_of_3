#=== ADDING SUBDIRECTORIES ===#
# The add_subdirectory() command allows a project to bring another directory into the build. That
# directory must have its own CMakeLists.txt file which will be processed at the point where
# add_subdirectory() is called and a corresponding directory will be created for it in the projectâ€™s
set ( TEST_NAME "run_tests")
add_subdirectory(tests)    # This will ask the tests to be generated
# set ( APP_NAME "some_app")
# add_subdirectory(src)
